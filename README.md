# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV-Python

Here, I would be specifying the details about the Hand Gesture Recognition's algorithm. The project displays the numbers of fingers(0-5) the user is showing to the webcam.
**Requirements**: The background in the ROI should be of a single colour, or else the user won't get accurate results.
